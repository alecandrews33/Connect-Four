# Connect-Four
A Connect Four game for a human player against a computer player. There are four different different computer players to choose from, with differing degrees of difficulty. I generated the code for the final_board and final_players files, while the files that ran all of these was provided by my professor. Run "python Connect4.py" in the working directory with the provided 4 files to begin a game where you will be prompted for your desired computer opponent.
